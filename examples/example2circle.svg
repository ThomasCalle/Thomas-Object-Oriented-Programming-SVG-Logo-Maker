<!-- Note: When generating a new "logo.svg" file through the command line prompt it will
'over-write' any pre-existing svg files named "logo.svg". So please ensure you have saved your "logo.svg" file under a new file name 
ending with ".svg" as this ensures your newly generated work is not altered and does not collide with any newly generated "logo.svg" files when 
initiated through the SVG logo maker. E.g: I have stored all fo my previously created work in the "examples" folder listed in the directory - in addition, each one of these
generated files have been assigned with a unique name (created by the user. aka myself) to ensure there are no collisions with newly generated files named "logo.svg". -->
